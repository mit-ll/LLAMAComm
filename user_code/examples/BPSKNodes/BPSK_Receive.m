function nodeobj = BPSK_Receive(nodeobj,modname,sig)

% Function BPSK_Receive.m:
% This is an example of a user-written callback function for a
% receive module.  This example demodulates an analog, BPSK signal.
%
% This example is designed to work with BPSK_Transmit
%
% USAGE: nodeobj = BPSK_Receive(nodeobj,modname,sig)
%
% Input arguments:
%  nodeobj    (node obj) Parent node object
%  modname    (string) The name of the module that has activated this
%              callback function
%  sig        (NxblockLen) Analog baseband signal for N channels
%
% Output arguments:
%  nodeobj    (node obj) Modified copy of the node object
%
% See also: BPSK_Transmit.m
