function [nodeobj,sig] = BPSK_Transmit(nodeobj,modname,blockLen)

% Function BPSK_Transmit.m:
% This is an example of a user-written callback function for a module
% object.  It generates or loads data to transmit. The output signal
% should be analog baseband, and can be multichannel.
%
% This example is a single-channel BPSK transmitter.  2x oversampled.
% There is no filtering or pulse shaping, so the signal is full bandwidth.
%
% USAGE: [nodeobj,sig] = BPSK_Transmit(nodeobj,modname,blockLen)
%
% Input arguments:
%  nodeobj    (node obj) Parent node object
%  modname    (string) The name of the module that has activated this
%              callback function
%  blockLen   (int) The block length of the analog signal expected
%              by the arbitrator
%
% Output arguments:
%  nodeobj    (node obj) Modified copy of the node object
%  sig        (NxblockLen) Analog baseband signal for N channels
