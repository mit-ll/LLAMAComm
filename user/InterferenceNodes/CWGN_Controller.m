function [nodeobj,status] = CWGN_Controller(nodeobj)

% Function user/CWGN_Controller.m:
% Controller state machine for an example interference source that
% transmits complex white gaussian noise in a specified band.
%
% USAGE: [nodeobj,status] = CWGN_Controller(nodeobj)
%
% Input arguments:
%  nodeobj    (node obj) Parent node object.  (The user node that called
%              contains a handle to this callback function.)
%
% Output arguments:
%  nodeobj    (node obj) Modified copy of node object
%  status     (string) Either 'running' or 'done'
