function [nodeobj,sig] = CWGN_Transmit(nodeobj,modname,blockLen)

% Function user/CWGN_Transmit.m:
% Interference transmitter.  Just white noise for now.
%
% USAGE: [nodeobj,sig] = CWGN_Transmit(nodeobj,modname,blockLen)
%
% Input arguments:
%  nodeobj    (node obj) Parent node object
%  modname    (string) The name of the module that has activated this
%              callback function
%  blockLen   (int) The block length of the analog signal expected
%              by the arbitrator
%
% Output arguments:
%  nodeobj    (node obj) Modified copy of the node object
%  sig        (NxblockLen) Analog baseband signal for N channels

% Load user parameters
p = GetUserParams(nodeobj);

% Make some noise data
filePow = 1; % Unitless file power
sig = sqrt(filePow/2)*complex(randn(1,p.blockLen), randn(1,p.blockLen));

% Set the transmitted signal power
sig = sqrt(p.power/filePow)*sig;

% Increment counter
p.transmittedBlocks = p.transmittedBlocks+1;

% Save user params
nodeobj = SetUserParams(nodeobj,p);
