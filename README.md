Lincoln Laboratory Ad-hoc Multi-input, multi-output Communication simulation tool (LLAMAComm) is a MATLAB-based software package 
for simulating cognitive Multi-Input, Multi-Output (MIMO) communications, cognitive radios and ad-hoc radio networks in the 
presence of interference. Users of this software create their own MATLAB functions that define the physical and link layers of 
a ratio of interest. LLAMAComm makes use of these functions and applies propagation models to simulate the transmission of the 
radio signal waveform. It also coordinates the simulation so that multiple radios may be simultaneously simulated.
