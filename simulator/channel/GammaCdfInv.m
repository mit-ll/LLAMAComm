function out = GammaCdfInv(cdfx,alph,theta)
% Function 'simulator/channel/GammaCdfInv.m':
% Evaluates the inverse gamma cdf paramaterized by alph and theta
%
%
% USAGE:  x = GammaCdfInv(cdfx,alph,lam)
%
% Input arguments:
%  cdfx             (double array)  cdf-values
%  alph             (double) Gamma pdf shape parameter
%  theta            (double) Gamma pdf scale parameter
%
% Output argument:
%  x                (double array) value of x which generates cdfx
