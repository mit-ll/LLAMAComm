% Function @module/RequestDone.m:
% Sets request flag low to signal completion of request.  Also
% adjusts the nextBlockStart parameter and stores the previous
% request into the history structure.
%
% USAGE: modobj = RequestDone(modobj,fPtr)
%
% Input arguments:
%  modobj     (module obj) Module to be modified
%  fPtr       (int) Offset that points to start of block in save file.
%              This value is returned by WriteSigBlock.  If fPtr is not
%              provided, the value will be set to -1 in the history
%              entry.
