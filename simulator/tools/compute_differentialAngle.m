function [az,el] = compute_differentialAngle(az,el,azRef,elRef)
% Given two sets of angles (az,el) and (azRef,elRef) in a common refernece
% system, rotate the reference system so the (azRef,elRef) = (0,0) and
% return the updated (az,el) with respect to this new reference system.
%
% The convention adopted is that of MATLAB's cart2sph:
%   Azimuth is computed counter-clockwise in the x-y plane from [1,0,0]
%   Elevation is the angle subtended between the vector and the x-y plane.
