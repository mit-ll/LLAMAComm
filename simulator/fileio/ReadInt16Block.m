function samples = ReadInt16Block(fid, nSamp, nChan)

% Function 'ReadInt16Block.m':
% Reads int16 data from a file and returns complex-valued samples
%
% USAGE: data = requestInterf(bandObj, nSamp, nChan)
%
% Input argument:
%  bandObj    (band object) Input band object
%  nSamp      (integer) Number of complex-valued samples to obtain
%  nChan      (integer) Number of channels (default is 1)
%
% Output argumetn:
%  samples    (nChan x N complex) Complex-valued samples
