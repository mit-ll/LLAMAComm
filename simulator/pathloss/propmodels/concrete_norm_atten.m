% NIST data
% P. Marchand - March 2005
% input:  f = frequency in GHz
% output: na = attenuation in dB per mm of thickness
% result is based on measured attenuation at frequency values
% [0.2:0.1:5.5] GHz, from W. C. Stone, $B!H(BElectromagnetic Signal Attenuation in

% Fire Research Laboratory, NIST Gaithersburg Mariland, 20899.
% Results may be somewhat high, as concrete used was fairly new, and concrete
% takes several years to dry thouroughly. Compared, e.g., with theoretical
% results produced by ConcreteSlat_fun.m, these results fall between theoretical
% results for 'wet' and 'saturated' concrete. However, theory also fails to account
% for non-homogeneous nature of actual concrete.
