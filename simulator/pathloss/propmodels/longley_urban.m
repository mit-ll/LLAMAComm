% function UFdb = longley_urban(dkm,fmhz);
% Urban correction factor for Longley-Rice propagation model.
% Suitable when one of Tx/Rx pair is below roof height in urban setting.
% Good for 100 MHz - 3 GHz and distances below 70 km.
% Good for 100 MHz - 500 MHz at distances beyond 70 km.
% Results are pretty much independent of antenna heights.
% From A. G. Longley, Radio Propagation in Urban Areas, US Dept.
% of Commerce/Office of Telecommunications, OT Report 78-144, April 1978.
% inputs: dkm  = distance, km
%         fmhz = frequency, MHz
% output: UFdb = excess excess-path-loss in dB
