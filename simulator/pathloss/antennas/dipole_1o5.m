function [ GdBi, DdBi ] = dipole_1o5(az, el, fmhz)
% function GdBi = dipole_1o5(az, el, fmhz)
% get antanna gain for a 1.5 m dipole in the direction specified
% by azimuth and elevation variables for signal at frequency fmhz
% All arguments must be scalar or equal sized matrices
% inputs: az = azimuth relative to peak of beam, degrees 
%              (this does nothing, but is needed for standard
%               antenna-gain-function format)
%         el = elevation angle relative to peak of beam, degrees
%         fmhz = signal frequency in MHz
% output: GdBi = antenna gain in dB relative to isotropic
