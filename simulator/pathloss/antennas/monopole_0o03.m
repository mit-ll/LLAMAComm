function [ GdBi, DdBi ] = monopole_0o03(az, el, fmhz)
% function GdBi = monopole_0o03(az, el, fhz)
% get antanna gain for a 3 cm  monopole (lambda/4 at f = 2500 MHz)
% in the direction specified by azimuth and elevation variables for signal
% at frequency fhz.
%
% All arguments must be scalar or equal sized matrices
% inputs: az = azimuth relative to peak of beam, this does nothing
%         el = elevation angle relative to peak of beam, degrees
%         fmhz = signal frequency in MHz
% output: GdBi = antenna gain in dB relative to isotropic
