% get antanna gain for an 8-element stacked-dipole array of
% 0.0601 m dipoles (lambda/2 at 2495 MHz). With no phase delay
% between elements.
% All arguments must be scalar or equal sized matrices
% inputs: az = azimuth relative to peak of beam, degrees
%              (this does nothing, but is needed for standard
%               antenna-gain-function format)
%         el = elevation angle relative to flat earth horizon, degrees
%         fmhz = signal frequency in MHz
% output: GdBi = antenna gain in dB relative to isotropic
