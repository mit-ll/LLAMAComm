function [hTime,linkInfo] = GetChannelResponse(linkobj,startSamps)

% Function link/GetChannelResponse.m:
% Get the impulse response of the channel as a function of time.
%
% USAGE: [hTime, linkInfo] = GetChannelResponse(linkobj,startSamps)
%
% Input arguments:
%  linkobj      (class link) link object
%  startSamps   (double array) Channel impulse response start samples
%
% Output arguments:
%  hTime        (nR x nT x nLag x length(startSamps) Impulse response
%  linkInfo     (struct) Structure containing link properties
%
% Example:
%
%  >> fs = 12.5e6; % (Hz) Simulation sample rate
%  >> % Sample the channel every millisecond for .1 seconds
%  >> Ndelta = fs*.001;
%  >> Nend   = fs*.1;
%  >> startSamps = [0:Ndelta:Nend];
%  >> hTime = GetChannelResponse(linkobj,startSamps);
%  >> % Plot the 1st tap of the channel between the 1st Tx and the 1st Rx
%  >> plot(startSamps/fs, squeeze(abs(hTime(1,1,1,:))))
