% Function '@node/GetChannelStruct.m':
% Builds channel struct which contains relevant parameters relating
% to the MIMO link.  This is the interface to Dan Bliss's code.
%
% USAGE:  channel = GetChannelStruct(nodeTx,modTx,nodeRx,modRx,propParams)
%
% Input arguments:
%  nodeTx           (node obj) Node transmitting
%  modTx            (module obj) Module transmitting
%  nodeRx           (node obj) Node receiving
%  modRx            (module obj) Module receiving
%  propParams       (struct) Structure containing Propagation parameters
%  pathLoss         (struct) Structure containing path loss parameters
%
% Output argument:
%  channel          (struct) Structure containing channel parameters
