function [nodes, status] = RunNodeControllers(nodes)

% Function @node/RunNodeControllers.m:
% Executes controller functions for all nodes.  This is analagous to
% clocking all the controllers once (for digital designers reading
% this).
%
% USAGE: [nodes, status] = RunNodeControllers(nodes)
%
% Input arguments:
%  nodes   (1xN node obj) Array of all node objects in the simulation
%           universe
%
% Output arguments:
%  nodes   (1xN node obj) Modified copies of node objects
%  status  (1xN string cell array) Status of node controllers.
%            Status should be 'running' or 'done'
