function nodeobj = SetLoCorrection(nodeobj,modname,loCorrection)

% Function @node/SetLoCorrection.m:
% Adjust the local oscillator frequency by a small amount. The 
% adjustment is given by the variable 'loCorrection'.
% For example, to adjust by -0.95 ppm, let loCorrection = -0.95e-6
% 
%
% USAGE: SetLoCorrection(modobj,modname,freqUpdate)
%
% Input argument:
%  nodeobj      (node obj) Node object
%  modname      (string) Module name
%  loCorrection (double) (parts) local oscillator adjustment
%
% Output argument:
%  nodeobj       (module obj) Updated node object
