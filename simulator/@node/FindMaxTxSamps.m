function nSamps = FindMaxTxSamps(nodes)

% Function '@nodes/FindMaxTxSamps.m':
%  Finds the longest transmit time (in samples).  This function is
%  used after a run has completed.
%
% USAGE:  nSamps = FindMaxTxSamps(nodes)
%
% Input arguments:
%  nodes       (node obj array) Array of node objects
%
% Output argument:
%  nSamps      (int) Maximum transmitted samples
